## Introduce
You probably would've refered to this [Android offical document](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/touch-input/pointer-input/multi-touch), when you had developed for compose multi-touch view including zoom, scale, rotation.
However you know the code that document says didn't work as you expected when the view was scaled up(down) or roated if you'd already try it. This sample is the code which those bugs have been fixed.
